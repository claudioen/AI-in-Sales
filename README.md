# AI-in-Sales


## 📌 Overview
This project explores how Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are being adopted by B2B sales professionals, with a focus on understanding usage patterns, organizational readiness, and user perceptions. The research was conducted as part of a Master's program at UCD Smurfit, in collaboration with EY.

## 🎯 Objective
To investigate the extent to which AI technologies are integrated into daily sales workflows, and to identify barriers, enablers, and implications for human-AI collaboration in the B2B sales environment.

## 🔍 Research Questions
1. How are AI tools currently being used by sales professionals?
2. What is the level of trust and satisfaction toward AI tools in the sales domain?
3. What training or support structures exist (or are lacking) in organizations?
4. What ethical or cultural concerns are raised by sales professionals using AI?

## 📚 Methodology
- **Primary Data**: A digital survey distributed to over 250 sales professionals, with ~30 full responses collected.
- **Questionnaire**: Included both multiple-choice and open-ended questions, covering frequency of AI use, tools adopted, training received, and perceived value.
- **Secondary Data**: Literature review including 20+ academic and policy sources on AI, automation, organizational behavior, and digital transformation.

## 🧠 Key Insights

### 1. Tool Adoption
- The most used tool by far is **ChatGPT**, highlighting a preference for general-purpose AI tools.
- Second most used: **Company-specific/custom tools**, showing some internal investment.
- AI is mostly used for content creation, email drafting, CRM insights, and lead scoring.

### 2. Organizational Support
- Formal training is rare (~17% received structured training).
- Most users are self-taught, with a clear demand for more internal enablement.

### 3. Trust and Attitudes
- Most users have **conditional trust** in AI tools.
- Trust is higher for factual analysis and lower for content generation.
- Ethical concerns raised include data privacy, deskilling, and decision transparency.

## 📈 Visual Results (Example Insights)
> “Approximately 83% of respondents reported using AI in their daily work, yet only 17% received formal training.”
> “Custom internal tools were the second most used AI solution after ChatGPT.”

## 🧩 Challenges
- Difficulty accessing large sample size.
- Targeted outreach limited to Europe, mainly Ireland.
- Limitations due to academic timeframe and ethics constraints.

## 🏁 Conclusions
- AI is actively reshaping B2B sales, though mostly at a tactical level.
- There’s a growing need for structured training and organizational policies.
- Human-AI collaboration is evolving—but trust, governance, and integration remain critical challenges.

## 🔄 Future Work
- Deeper qualitative studies (e.g., interviews with sales leaders).
- Broader geographic sampling.
- Closer study of organizational AI maturity frameworks.
